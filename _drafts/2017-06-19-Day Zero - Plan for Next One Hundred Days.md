# What are the areas of focus?
I am struggling with focus for a long time. Coupled with a lot of failed ventures I am just becoming too easy to instigate. So my plan for this week is to keep focus on the following areas:
## Health
### Running 
This week I plan to run for 5 days atleast for 30 minutes. Pacing does not matter though I would like to stay below 6Min/Km.
### Other Exercises
Seven Hundred Squats, 250 Push ups this week.
### 7 Minutes Full body work out
Try and keep doing 7 minutes full body workout everyday. I am on my 8th day without break so let's see how much better it can get.
## Mind
Try to get into periodic check
### Og Mandino
Get into a habit of going though og Mandino Audio three times a day.
### Meditation
Get back into 10 minutes of meditation.
## Knowledge
I don't know what to do here. I think just doing something better than today will help. May be **Establishing Anki** to remember facts will be great.
## Social Growth
This week I am building a complete map of my _social graph_. I have noticed that people are super helpful and ready to interact and fault lies entirely on my side to ignore them for too long. My introvented tendencies does become an hidenrance so this week I will spend sometime daily talking to
## Professional Growth
I have solely decided to focus on field of Artificial Intelligence so I plan to divide my time between shallow machine learning and deep learning.
### Machine Learning
I am following the book *Building Machine Learning Systems With Python*. After completing first chapter, I feel second chanpter is a little underwhelming as it does not explain how topic modelling framework actually works. A lot of knowledge is assumed but let's see how it goes. 
### Deep Learning
For deep learning I am following https://course.fast.ai because its practical and I can learn rest of the things as I progress.
### Supporting Material
As a suppirting material, I am trying to follow **Great Courses: Mathematical Decision Making Course** on the side. I am not sure, this will be helpful fully but having something during the Running and commute is going to be super useful.
## Writing
I want to get back into writing again. What I am not going to do this time is to again start following the cookbooks. I will write and just go though the motion of it. I will reserve judgement for future when it arrives. **_NO READING BOOKS ON WRITING_**.
## Reading
Finish and make notes of *Start Day Trading Now*.

# Plan for next week
## Learn Quantopian or Zipline Python Library
