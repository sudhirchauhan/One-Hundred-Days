I am ways restless when it comes to learning. I always want to be the smart kind in the room so I have ended up learning and experimenting with a lotfs of technologies even when they didn't help me directly in my job or life. I spent countless hours trying to learn **JavaScript,Python,React,Djago,Angular,git,zsh,bash, NLTK,Scikit-Learn** etc only to find myself dropping them a few weeks later once I had enough understanding fo the subject. It turns out that being a **Jack of All Trades** is only takes you so far.

To counter this I have decided to pick **Deep Learning** for next one hundred days. I belive this will be suffciently challenging to keep me from going sideways into other area. 

## Plan
Deep learning for someone who does not have an in depth knowledge of does not work out very well. Having said that trying to Learn the maths upfront didn't work very well whenever I have tried. Fortunately I cam across a very good free set of lectures by **Jeremy Howard**. He takes a diffrent approach and starts right with a working example ands slowly dives into enough details to make it understandable. He argues "How the game will look like, if you force baseball players to learn the physics of ball movement and only allow them to play on the field when they have understood those basics."

He then points to rest of the details on either his Wiki pages or to resources like Khan Academy and one Blue three brown youtube courses.I decided to follow suit and couple of lectures later I can now write a Deep Convolutional Network in high level library like keras.

Encouraged by these early success I decided to follow the practical approach. Here is the Plan.

### Practical Deep Learning For Codes Part I
This is the main course I am following. Currently I am at lecture number 4 with a good enough understanding of mechanics of the models.

### Additional Resources
### Linear Algebra
#### [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices)
#### [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

### Statistics
#### Statitics Made Easy Book
I am following this book and trying to carry out exercises in python using numpy,scipy, and pandas.
#### Think Stats2
As this is considered a seminal book in practical statistics. I have plans to work through this as well.
#### Mathematical Decision Making
I am following this course in Audio format while running to see how the ideas are sticking into my head.

### Data Visualization
#### MatplotLib
I do not want to commit hours to learn this area but its important so I am going to follow [this tutorial](http://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html) and see how I am doing.

### Calculus
I am not too keen to learn this as it seems most of the calculus is handled by libraries anyways.
