I set out with a list of lofty goals for next **One Hundred Days**. This review hopes to capture what I actually did over the week. 
## Health Review

My losing health is the main reason I started on this journey of **Self Realization**. Last year was full of turns and turmoils and I ended up becoming unhealthy and overweight. I realized this only when I started breaking into **drenching sweat** just by walking a little bit fast. I had to take of my jackets in 0 degree Centigrade in middle of the road. I have a draft post to write about it **TODO: How I recovered from breaking into sweat to run 5,10, & 17 Kilometers regularly**.

According to standard BMI metrics,I am still overweight. Over the years I have struggled to maintain healty weight but going over 85 Kgs was an eye opener for me. After achiveving success with **TODO: Keeping a Routine**, I became intrigued and started follolwing a plan **LINK: ONE HUNDRED DAYS** 
As you can see my First goal was to improve my health. Not in the sense that I want to break some records but to say to myself that I am Healthy and feel energised.

### Running 
I planned to run for 30 minutes for five days per week and I am happy to report that I did this exactly. Secondary goal of staying under 6Min/Km didn't get achived every day.

#### Monday Morning
I ran a total of 5.08 Km in 28.50 Minutes.
#### Tuesday Morning
I again ran a 3Km at a pace of 5.04Min/Km.
#### Wednesday Evening
A 4Km run at a relaxed pace of 6:19Min/Km followed by 1Km walk at a pace of 8.45Min/Km.
#### Friday Morning Run
A 10.03 Km run at a pace of 6.13Km/Min. This was the longest run in entire week.
#### Sunday Morning Run
A 5.06Km run on a pace of 6.00Km/Min followied by a 2.10Km walk at a pace of 9.08Km/Min.

### Other Exercises
Seven Hundred Squats, 250 Push ups this week.
#### Squats
I did 100 Squats on 21 and 24 of June. Needless to say, I didn't keep my plan of doing the squats every otherday.
#### Push Ups
I did 52 Pushups on 21,24,and 25th of June. I wanted to do it for 4 days per week.
### 7 Minutes Full body work out
I am happy I did this workout every single day. Sometimes I missed on the timing and sometimes I just didn't had the motivation but I endured. To the youthful and fit 7 Minutes might not look heavy but it was very hard for me.
#### Other Exercises
I tried my hands on stetching, did squat and hold and improved some.

## TODO: Mind
I lost control this week on Saturday and felt very bad about it. I think need to be an area of Focus. I failed to all of it. Infact I did didn't thought I need to do these activities atall. Another instance of ADHD palying up.
### Og Mandino
Get into a habit of going though og Mandino Audio three times a day.
### Meditation


# Social Growth
This week I am building a complete map of my _social graph_. I have noticed that people are super helpful and ready to interact and fault lies entirely on my side to ignore them for too long. My introvented tendencies does become an hidenrance so this week I will spend sometime daily talking to them.
## Professional Growth
I have solely decided to focus on field of Artificial Intelligence so I plan to divide my time between shallow machine learning and deep learning.
### Machine Learning
I am following the book *Building Machine Learning Systems With Python*. After completing first chapter, I feel second chanpter is a little underwhelming as it does not explain how topic modelling framework actually works. A lot of knowledge is assumed but let's see how it goes. 
### Deep Learning
For deep learning I am following https://course.fast.ai because its practical and I can learn rest of the things as I progress.
### Supporting Material
As a suppirting material, I am trying to follow **Great Courses: Mathematical Decision Making Course** on the side. I am not sure, this will be helpful fully but having something during the Running and commute is going to be super useful.
## Writing
I want to get back into writing again. What I am not going to do this time is to again start following the cookbooks. I will write and just go though the motion of it. I will reserve judgement for future when it arrives. **_NO READING BOOKS ON WRITING_**.
## Reading
Finish and make notes of *Start Day Trading Now*.

# Plan for next week
## Learn Quantopian or Zipline Python Library
